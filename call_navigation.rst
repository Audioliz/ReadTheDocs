Search and Navigate Calls
==========================
1. Search a call
----------------

For a large number of loaded calls, it becomes useful to have filters. In the 'Search' feature, you can search for calls with specific characters or for a particular call.

Let's search for the call in the previous video:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\search.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>
