3. Supervision and Question Adjustment Process
---------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Continuous Improvement of Question Formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since call analysis is performed by an AI system, it is expected that some answers may be incorrect. These inaccuracies can often be traced back to unclear or poorly formulated questions.

As part of our continuous improvement process, we aim to refine the way questions are written. This effort involves both our internal team and the client, as misunderstandings about the client's actual needs can also lead to discrepancies.

To address this, we have implemented a parallel procedure on the client‚Äôs side:

- A supervisor reviews and corrects incorrect answers manually for specific questions.

- The supervisor must fill in the **Counter evaluation by** field with their name.

- They are also encouraged to add comments explaining the corrections made.

On our side, we are committed to adjusting the relevant questions based on the supervisors‚Äô feedback, with the goal of minimizing the gap between the AI‚Äôs analysis and the human evaluation ‚Äî a goal that we actively monitor through the AI / HUMAN page on our Power BI dashboard.

3.2 Evaluation and Supervision Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To ensure the quality and accuracy of AI-based analyses, supervisors on the client side are expected to review and validate the AI's responses for specific calls. The following steps outline the recommended evaluation procedure:

- Access the call page that needs to be reviewed.

- Fill in the **Counter evaluation by** field with the supervisor‚Äôs name.

- Specify the evaluation date in the **Counter evaluation date** field.

- Review the scoring section and enter the value in **Score before counter evaluation**.

To help our team better understand the corrections, it is strongly encouraged to add a comment in the following format:

question_name: incorrect AI answer ‚Üí correct answer | reason for the change

In addition, the supervisor should review the AI-generated responses, click on any incorrect answers, and manually correct them. They can also leave a more detailed comment on each question if needed.
