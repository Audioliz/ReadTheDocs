Dashboards
==========

If you want to use a dashboard that was created by another user in the system, follow these steps:

1. Go to the section called **"All Dashboards"**
2. Locate the dashboard you want to use (e.g., alert monitoring, performance tracking, etc.)
3. Click on the **eye icon** to open it

Once inside the dashboard, you will find several options in the top-right corner:

You can choose between the following actions:

- **Add to my favorites**  
  Adds the dashboard to your side menu. Any future changes made by the original creator will be reflected on your side.

- **Duplicate**  
  Creates a fully independent copy of the dashboard. You can then customize it freely (add widgets, edit filters, etc.) without affecting the original.

- **Set as Home Page**  
  If you want this dashboard to appear when you log in, click the gear icon and enable “Home Page” from the settings.
