Questions
=========

You can modify/create as many questions as you want in your monitoring sheet. There are three types of questions:

Question Text
-------------

You can choose a question text when the answer is a paragraph. For example: 'Give me the summary of the call' or 'What topics were discussed in the call?'

If you have a yes/no question, it is preferable not to select this type of question.

Let's create a question text:

One Choice Question
-------------------

A single choice question is used when there is only one possible answer. It's usually used with yes/no questions.

Let's try it:

.. video:: /_static/create_question_ONE_CHOICE.mp4
  :width: 640
  :height: 360

Multiple Choices Question
-------------------------

A multiple choice question is used when the answer is not necessarily unique. In this case, you can have multiple answers.

Let's see an example:

.. video:: /_static/create_question_MULTIPLE_CHOICES.mp4

  :height: 360

To modify a question, it's very simple. Just click on it and change the fields that you want to modify.
