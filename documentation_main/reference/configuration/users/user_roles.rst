User Roles
==========

In Audioliz, each user has a role that defines what they can do and access within the platform. Roles are used to control permissions based on responsibilitiesâ€”such as reading data, editing scorecards, managing users, or commenting on calls.

Predefined Roles
----------------

Role	Description
Admin	: Full access to all features and functionalities
Supervisor :	Can do everything except user administration
External supervisor :	Like agents, but can also comment on calls and edit metadata
Agent	: Can view calls and answer grids, but cannot manage users or settings

You can see this list by navigating to Configuration > Users > ROLES:

ðŸ”Ž Tip
If you don't see the role options or can't edit them, it means your account doesn't have admin privileges. You'll need to contact an administrator to update roles.
