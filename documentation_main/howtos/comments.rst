Continuous improvement with comments
====================================

If you disagree with the AI's automatic evaluation, you can request a review through the **counter evaluation** workflow.

Steps to follow:
----------------

1. Open the evaluation view of the call
2. In the section **Conter evaluation by**, enter your **first name** to identify yourself

Workflow explanation:
---------------------

- **|$|Open|$|** = a new comment is submitted and waiting for review  
- **|$|Pending|$|** = a reviewer is working on your case before giving an answer  
- **|$|Replied|$|** = a reply has been written in the `ANSWER` field  
- **|$|Closed|$|** = the problem is resolved and the process is complete

This system ensures that every feedback is reviewed and responded to by the quality team in a structured and traceable way.
