1. Create a question
--------------------

You can modify/create as many questions as you want in your monitoring sheet. There are three types of questions:

1.1 Question Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose a question text when the answer is a paragraph. For example: 'Give me the summary of the call' or 'What topics were discussed in the call?'

If you have a yes/no question, it is preferable not to select this type of question.

Let's create a question text:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_text.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

1.2 One choice question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single choice question is used when there is only one possible answer. It's usually used with yes/no questions.

Let's try it:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_ONE CHOICE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

1.3 Multiple choices question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A multiple choice question is used when the answer is not necessarily unique. In this case, you can have multiple answers.

Let's see an example:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_MULTIPLE CHOICES.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

To modify a question, it's very simple. Just click on it and change the fields that you want to modify.

2. Change monitoring sheet parameters
-------------------------------------

You can change many parameters in your monitoring grid. Let's see how:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\action.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>
