Tutoriel Audioliz
=================

This is a tutorial on how to use Audioliz, from the very beginning to your first call analysis. Let's go!

1. Visualize call analysis
--------------------------

After every call is analyzed, you can see all the useful information about it:

-General information about the call: date of creation, audio file name, duration, agent, call type, called number, etc.
-The transcript of the call
-The call audio file
-Questions/responses with explanations on each response, and the possibility to listen exactly where the answers are given in the call.


.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\call_description.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

2. How to load a call
---------------------

To analyze the next calls, you should first load them.

Let's load our first call:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\charger_call.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>
3. Create a question
--------------------

You can modify/create as many questions as you want in your monitoring sheet. There are three types of questions:

3.1 Question Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose a question text when the answer is a paragraph. For example: 'Give me the summary of the call' or 'What topics were discussed in the call?'

If you have a yes/no question, it is preferable not to select this type of question.

Let's create a question text:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_text.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

3.2 One choice question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single choice question is used when there is only one possible answer. It's usually used with yes/no questions.

Let's try it:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_ONE CHOICE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

3.3 Multiple choices question
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A multiple choice question is used when the answer is not necessarily unique. In this case, you can have multiple answers.

Let's see an example:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\create_question_MULTIPLE CHOICES.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

To modify a question, it's very simple. Just click on it and change the fields that you want to modify.

4. Re-run a call analysis
-------------------------

If you change a question in the monitoring sheet, and you want to re run an analysis on a call, here's how to do it:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\rerun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

5. Search a call
----------------

For a large number of loaded calls, it becomes useful to have filters. In the 'Search' feature, you can search for calls with specific characters or for a particular call.

Let's search for the call in the previous video:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\search.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

6. Change monitoring sheet parameters
-------------------------------------

You can change many parameters in your monitoring grid. Let's see how:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static\action.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

7.How to visualize the questions with or without a score ?
----------------------------------------------------------

In the analysis grid, you can choose to display all the questions, those with a score, or those without a score.

10. How to find and respond to comments left on an analyzed call ?
------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to click on the "comment" field, a tab will open where you can filter by call date, agent, CRM ID. 
To find the comments left, click on the "DEBUG STATUS" field and select the "OPEN" option to display all the analyzed calls where a comment has been left. At this point, you have the option to quickly view all comments left on calls by clicking on the two arrows next to "üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è". Or reply to the comments by clicking on "üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è", opening the call analysis grid, and following these steps:
