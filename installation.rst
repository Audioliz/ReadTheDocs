=================

This is a tutorial on how to use Audioliz, from the very beginning to your first call analysis. Let's go!

1. Visualize call analysis
--------------------------

After every call is analyzed, you can see all the useful information about it:

-General information about the call: date of creation, audio file name, duration, agent, call type, called number, etc.
-The transcript of the call
-The call audio file
-Questions/responses with explanations on each response, and the possibility to listen exactly where the answers are given in the call.

3. Create a question
--------------------

You can modify/create as many questions as you want in your monitoring sheet. There are three types of questions:

3.1 Question Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose a question text when the answer is a paragraph. For example: 'Give me the summary of the call' or 'What topics were discussed in the call?'

If you have a yes/no question, it is preferable not to select this type of question.
