First Steps with Audioliz
=================

This is a tutorial on how to use Audioliz, from the very beginning to your first call analysis. Let's go!

1. Visualize call analysis
--------------------------

After every call is analyzed, you can see all the useful information about it:

-General information about the call: date of creation, audio file name, duration, agent, call type, called number, etc.
-The transcript of the call
-The call audio file
-Questions/responses with explanations on each response, and the possibility to listen exactly where the answers are given in the call.


.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static/call_description.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

2. How to load a call
---------------------

To analyze the next calls, you should first load them.

Let's load our first call:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static/charger_call.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>

3. Re-run a call analysis
-------------------------

If you change a question in the monitoring sheet, and you want to re run an analysis on a call, here's how to do it:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <video width="640" height="360" controls>
       <source src="_static/rerun.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     </video>
   </div>
