4. Access and reuse an existing dashboard
-----------------------------------------

If you want to use a dashboard that was created by another user in the system, follow these steps:

1. Go to the section called **"All Dashboards"**
2. Locate the dashboard you want to use (e.g., alert monitoring, performance tracking, etc.)
3. Click on the **eye icon** to open it

Once inside the dashboard, you will find several options in the top-right corner:

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/Dashbord.png" width="500" alt="Dashboard list">
   </div>

You can choose between the following actions:

- **Add to my favorites**  
  Adds the dashboard to your side menu. Any future changes made by the original creator will be reflected on your side.

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/ADD_TO_MY_FAVORITES.png" width="300" alt="Add to my favorites">
   </div>

- **Duplicate**  
  Creates a fully independent copy of the dashboard. You can then customize it freely (add widgets, edit filters, etc.) without affecting the original.

- **Set as Home Page**  
  If you want this dashboard to appear when you log in, click the gear icon and enable “Home Page” from the settings.

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/Dashbord_Settings.png" width="400" alt="Dashboard settings">
   </div>

















5. How to manage and respond to comments ?
-------------------------------------------

If you disagree with the AI's automatic evaluation, you can request a review through the **counter evaluation** workflow.

### Steps to follow:

1. Open the evaluation view of the call
2. In the section **Conter evaluation by**, enter your **first name** to identify yourself

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/Conter_evaluation_by.png" width="700" alt="Conter evaluation by field">
   </div>

3. Scroll down and enter your explanation or justification in the **Comment** section

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/Comment.png" width="800" alt="Comment section input">
   </div>

4. Set the **Debug Status** to `Open` to notify the quality team

.. raw:: html

   <div style="text-align: center;">
     <img src="_static/Debug_Status.png" width="400" alt="Debug status dropdown">
   </div>

### Workflow explanation:

- **Open** = a new comment is submitted and waiting for review  
- **Pending** = a reviewer is working on your case before giving an answer  
- **Replied** = a reply has been written in the `ANSWER` field  
- **Closed** = the problem is resolved and the process is complete

This system ensures that every feedback is reviewed and responded to by the quality team in a structured and traceable way.
