Continuous improvement with comments
====================================

If you disagree with the AI's automatic evaluation, you can request a review through the **counter evaluation** workflow.

Steps to follow:
----------------

1. Open the evaluation view of the call
2. In the section **Conter evaluation by**, enter your **first name** to identify yourself

   </div>

3. Scroll down and enter your explanation or justification in the **Comment** section

   <div style="text-align: center;">

4. Set the **Debug Status** to `Open` to notify the quality team

Workflow explanation:
---------------------

- **Open** = a new comment is submitted and waiting for review  
- **Pending** = a reviewer is working on your case before giving an answer  
- **Replied** = a reply has been written in the `ANSWER` field  
- **Closed** = the problem is resolved and the process is complete

This system ensures that every feedback is reviewed and responded to by the quality team in a structured and traceable way.
